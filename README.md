Numpy is used in this program because it can perform a wide range of mathematical operations on arrays, as well as Matpotlib and Seaborn to understand and explore your data. TensorFlow provides you with the flexibility and control with features like the Keras Functional API and Model Subclassing API for creation of complex topologies, and from tensor kensor datasets we are importing, we also use MNist to test and collaborate. RMS prop is used to speed up the optimization process. Dense layer and flatten are used to categorize images using output from convolutional layers and pooling feature maps, respectively. Conv2D is imported because it is a 2D Convolution Layer; this layer builds a convolution kernel that is wound with the inputs of the layers and aids in producing a tensor of outputs. Here, the type of operation known as Max pooling is often introduced to CNNs after each individual convolutional layer. From here, we extract the dataset, train it, test it, find the accuracy by predicting it, find the plot of the confusion matrices, provide training and testing loss and accuracy plots in one plot using the subplot command and history object, provide at least two additional visualizations that reflect the solution, and finally provide a logical explanation of the steps that improved response for a new dataset when compared to the baseline model, and then depending on the final accuracy, improving the architecture.
